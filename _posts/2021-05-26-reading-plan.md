There is no more than 2 months before finishing my undergraduate study and leaving UESTC. I am a little sad about it when I have to say goodbye to my friends, roommates, and the school. 

Moreover, at this time, I realized that I didn't make the best use of the library during the 4 years I spent here. Although I often went to the library to do the homework and projects, I didn't actually read any of the books in the library. I decided to read more books to improve myself inwardly before leaving. 

Thus, I start this reading plan which will push me to read more well-recognized and -written books. This reading plan is very simple and straightforward, which is just to read books, summarize, and think!

I've read Ordinary World a few days ago and I'll update my thoughts about it as soon as possible. Currently, I'm reading *the willpower instinct* and *poor economics*.
